# SHMUP REMIX - Oh No! Space Pirates!
Oh No, Space Pirates! is my take on one of my favorite games of all time, galaga.

What makes the game unique is that you can abduct enemies and then use their power for your own.

I attempted to go for something with the feel and difficulty of an original coin-op SHMUP, with the visuals of the slightly more advanced 32-bit NES era.

I wanted to keep the player contstantly on their toes by having randomly generated challenge rounds, which is where I got the idea for space pirates

I designed all the sprites on this game, which in retrospect was probably too ambitious for the project but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I own everything in this game except for the background and the music(Please don't sue me Mort Garson's Estate, k thx)
