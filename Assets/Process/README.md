# 9/28/2020 Refinement
I have decided on my core mechanic being the "triple shooter" ship that abducts enemies in order to gain their powers.
The player loses when all their slots are empty

My game will differ from galaga primarily in procedures and resources. I will be adding a procedure for gaining new weapons, and change the game over procedure.
I will also be chaning how the lives resources work and adding a new weapons resource that's tied to the lives resource.

The primary player challange I will be adding is picking and managing what kind of ships to use, and when to get rid of them. This adds more nuance and progression to the challenges typically involved in galaga. The other new challenge is letting enemies get close enough to abduct them, without being damaged.

The basic rules have a strong basis in galaga. There will be procedurely generated waves of enemies that grow stronger with time, and descend toward the player, shooting projectiles. The player has 3 slots on their ship and can abduct a ship into each of them. The player starts with one ship in the middle slot. Once the player has abducted a ship into one of their slots, they can use that ship's weapons. The player loses if they have no ships in any of their slots.
Randomly, there will be a "Space Pirates" round. Space pirates are faster and have better weapons, but there are fewer of them. They are also worth more points. This replaces the challenge round of traditional Galaga.

# 10/7/2020 First Test
I have spent so much time developing sprites for this game, that for my play test today, I only have a "tech demo" of sorts that shows off my primary abduction mechanic. In the coming days, I will be adding my new enemies and polishing into something that someone might call a game.

My playtester and I discussed how the aesthetic of my game felt, whether the abduction mechanic felt rewarding, possible ways to keep score, and her overall first impressions

Overall I learned to decrease the speed of my ship, decrease the speed of enemy ships, decrease the abduction lock-out timer, amd create more pirate-themed ships.

I also slightly redid my single and doulbe shooter sprites, because me and my playtester agreed that they didn't quite fit.

# 10/13/2020 The Day of Reckoning
I have spent the last few days doing basically nothing but programmning this game. Because of the content I added last minute, I haven't gotten the chance to have a bunch of playtests on the new content, but I plan on working on this game past the due date.

I spent a long time redoing the enenmy spawning script and to be honest it kind of kicks ass now so be sure to look at that.

Wishlist for future development:
Audio on all weapon fires
At least two new ships
More levels if people ever get to them
Slight redo of some of my more basic ships
High score entry
